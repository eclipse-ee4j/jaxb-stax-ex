# Extended StAX API

This project contains a few extensions to complement JSR-173 StAX API in the following areas:

* Enable parser instance reuse (which is important in the high-performance environment
like [Eclipse Implementation of JAXB](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/ee4j.jaxb-impl)
and [Eclipse Metro](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/ee4j.metro))
* Improve the support for reading from non-text XML infoset, such as [FastInfoset](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jaxb-fi).
* Improve the namespace support.

This project is part of [Eclipse Implementation of JAXB](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/ee4j.jaxb-impl).
